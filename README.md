# Rental-Equipment-booking-service


The project will let people create an account by entering their username, email, and password. After logging in, 
Users will go to the rental equipment page, where they can choose an item to rent, along with the rental period and return date. 
Once they've made their selections, they'll see a final page that confirms their booking was successful and thanks them for using the service.

The user will start in signup.html, enter their information.
Next, the user will enter the information they used to make their account on the login page.
Once the login is successful, they can rent one of four items and select a rental date and return date.
Once the information has been entered, the user will be taken to a final screen confirming that they successfully rented an item.
