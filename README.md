# Rental-Equipment-booking-service


The project will let people create an account by entering their username, email, and password. After logging in, 
users will go to the rental equipment page, where they can choose an item to rent, along with the rental period and return date. 
Once they've made their selections, they'll see a final page that confirms their booking was successful and thanks them for using the service.
